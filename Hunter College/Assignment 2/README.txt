Code compiles and executes

Miscalculations:
5b is slightly off within decimal number for both AVL and BST

Everything else outputs as expected

To run:
make clean
make all 
./query_tree rebase210.txt BST < input_part2a.txt   or   ./query_tree rebase210.txt AVL < input_part2a.txt

./test_tree rebase210.txt sequences.txt AVL   or    ./test_tree rebase210.txt sequences.txt BST

./test_tree_mod rebase210.txt sequences.txt
